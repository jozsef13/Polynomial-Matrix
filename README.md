# Polynomial-Matrix
Homework/Project that I had to do for OOP course at college.
A polynomial matrix is a matrix that has all its elements polynomials with real coefficients. I created a module that does some operations like:
- Creating a polynomial matrix
- Printing the polynomial matrix
- The addition of two polynomial matrices
- The multiplication of two polynomial matrices
- The evaluation of a polynomial matrix for a given value.
